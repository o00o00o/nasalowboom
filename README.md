Our app using the Google Maps Api can find and zoom into your current location using the built in gps capbilities of your phone. Then by hiting the buttons “sonic boom” or “low boom” the app displays the specfic area that is effected by each of the booms. The app allows the user to overlay both effected area as to visual compare the impact zones. Furthermore the app will also play a sound clip of a sonic/low boom that would be similar to what would be heard in real life depending ond accoustics of the geographical location. Notice how the boom is heard after the aircraft has flow over the traget area, this is because the jet is traveling faster than the speed of sound thus the “boom” is heard after the jet has passed. The zones that that the apps display will corrispond to the physical effects that a real boom would cause. For example a sonic boom from an aircraft at 500 feet caused over $300,000 of damages incluing window glass. (Page 8, EPA Effects of Sonic Boom and Similar Impulsive Noise on Structures) 

This app can be utilized by civilians wanting more infomation regarding the effects of sonic booms at specfic geographical areas, such as one's home. This can lead to an inform voted on new legislation that will regulate supersonic travel in the future. 

Furthermore this app can be used by goverment officals that are trageting sonic travel. This is a realivetly new and growing indsutry and relitable data is need to create legistlation that can regulate and promote the use of supersonic travel. This can inlude an amendment to building code in specfic location such as near airports to require “sonic proof” windows as a precaution for public safety.

Lastly the app can be used by companys such as a new start up called Boom Aerospace who are developing an affordable super solution and one that can be used at a comerical scale. Use of new technology can effectively reduce the noise level of an aircraft producing a low boom instead of an sonic boom. The data that this app can generate will impact the design of such an aircraft as the company can see the effects of their aircraft in order to meet goverment regulations.
